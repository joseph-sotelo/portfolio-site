To create a new case study:
1. Create a new page:
    - Create a folder in the 'work' directory, where the case study page will go.
    - create a tsx page. Copy and paste the contents from any other page in the 'work' directory
2. Add content to case-studies.json
    - case-studies.json contains an array of caseStudy objects. Copy one of them and paste it to the end of the array, then start customizing the content.
3. Add static menu content
    - open up context-menu.json
    - copy/paste the last item in the array to the end of the array
    - replace content
4. Create photo library
    - inside of public/work create a folder for the case study
    - any images or videos that will appear in the case study should be stored here
