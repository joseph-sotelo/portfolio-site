To create a new case study:
1. Create a new page:
    - Create a folder in the 'work' directory, where the case study page will go.
    - create a tsx page. Copy and paste the contents from any other page in the 'work' directory
2. Add content to case-studies.json
    - case-studies.json contains an array of caseStudy objects. Copy one of them and paste it to the end of the array, then start customizing the content.
